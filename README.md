# Shifty Dungeon

![Shifty Dungeon logo](itch-io-cover_315x250.png)

A game originally made for the [GMTK GameJam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) for the theme "Roles Reversed".

It is kind of a classic Adventurer searches for the Treasure game with two twists: the Dugneon Master rotates the tiles, and the role of the Adventurer and the DM swaps during gameplay.

The jam was 48 hours long however my entry was made in about 10 hours.

The jam had a *lot* of strong entries, I was genuinely surprised it ranked right around the middle. (For Creativity it ranked in the top 25% - I'm grateful for the people seeing the potential.)
